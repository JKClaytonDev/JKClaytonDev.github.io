<h3>Game Design:</h3>
Castillo Shattered Mirrors is a mix between a retro shooter and collect-a-thon. The player must travel to different worlds via a hub-castle to collect shards that unlock new areas in the hub. Castilloâ€™s Game Design was based around total player freedom. The game takes place in a large hub world where players can decide which levels to collect shards in. Different players may take different routes depending on their preferences. Each of the enemies in the game is designed to amplify the threat of other enemies, when specific enemy types are combined it can be a large threat to the player who should be able to easily recognize it and use the correct method(s) to kill it (which vary by enemy type). It makes it easy for me to challenge players by doing things like removing ammo pickups for an effective gun in a level.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The individual shard levels are short. There are 3 levels per world and each level teaches the player more about both the world they traveled to and the new enemies it introduces. Each level was designed to be quickly consumable but to feel immersive. My approach was to ease the player into each world with familiar enemies and to amplify both the horror and gameplay at the end of the first level and steadily amplifying it for the second with a hard final test for the last level. I justify the spike for the final level with the promise of a new weapon at the end of each world.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The characters in Castillo were designed to be seen as 2D sprites in a 3D environment. My initial struggle was that the characters seemed to blend in from a distance and it became hard to differentiate between them. My solution for this was to keep ranged enemies visually distinct in terms of sprites or animation. This was not an issue for close ranged enemies. <br><br>
