<h3>Game Design:</h3>
Castilloâ€™s Game Design was based around total player freedom. Players can approach everything in the game from multiple different methods in a way that is accessible but also rewarding to all skill levels. The game takes place in a large hub world where players can decide which levels to collect shards in. Different players may take different routes depending on their preferences. The enemy design was based on point-and-click horror games as a different approach. Each of the enemies in the game is designed to amplify the threat of other enemies, when specific enemy types are combined it can be a large threat to the player who should be able to easily recognize it.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The individual shard levels are short. There are 3 levels per world and each level teaches the player more about both the world they traveled to and the new enemies it introduces. Each of the levels was designed to be quickly consumable but to feel like its own world with much more beyond what's seen in the game. My approach was to ease the player into each world with familiar enemies and to amplify both the horror and gameplay at the end of the first level while then steadily amplifying it for the second and including a hard final test for the last level. I justify the spike for the final level with the promise of a new weapon at the end of each world.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The characters in Castillo were designed to be seen as 2D sprites in a 3D environment. My initial struggle was that the characters seemed to blend in from a distance and it became hard to differentiate between them. My solution for this was to make all ranged enemies very visually distinct from each other in terms of sprites or animation. For some enemies, it was an intentional challenge for the player to differentiate the enemies through subtle queues. The game also includes some enemies with similar silhouettes but are only fought from a very close range. <br><br>
