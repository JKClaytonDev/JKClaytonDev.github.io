<h3>Game Design:</h3>
Castillo Shattered Mirrors is a mix between a retro shooter and collect-a-thon. The player travels to different worlds via a hub-castle to collect shards that unlock new areas. The game design emphasizes player freedom. The game takes place in a hub world where players can decide which levels to complete. Players take different routes based on their preferences. The enemy design was also a focus. Each enemy changes the threat of other enemies. When specific enemy types are together, it can be a threat to the player who can easily recognize it and use the correct method(s) to kill it (which vary by enemy type). It makes it easy to challenge players by surprising them with enemy design. I can make an enemy much more threatening in a level by removing ammo pickups for a specific gun or using another enemy to buff them.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The individual levels are quickly consumable but immersive. The first level of each world has familiar enemies and concepts with a steady introduction of new ideas and an amplification at the end, which intensifies the new enemy introduction in level 2. The third level gives the player a final test with this threat and where you see a thrilling conclusion to the world the player is in.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
All of the enemies are 2D sprites that face the camera. Enemies originally were harder to identify from a distance during combat situations. 3D models are easier to differentiate because they can rotate. My solution was to keep long-ranged enemies sprites or animation visually distinct. If two enemies had a similar silhouette, differences in animation make it easy to identify them.<br><br>
