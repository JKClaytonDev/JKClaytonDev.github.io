This is my personal portfolio website.

My name is Jackson Clayton. I am a Games and Simulations major at Miami University (Ohio). I grew up in northern Virginia, where I taught myself how to make games using Scratch.

I am a passionate game developer and designer who focuses on mixing game genres and styles. I study and polish my level and gameplay design to give players new and engaging experiences. I do so through a broad range of subjects (level geometry, gameplay elements, lighting, animation, etc.).

I released my first full game in early 2019 and have released 14 games on itch.io and two games on Steam since. I normally develop projects for PC but am familiar with both mobile and Xbox development.

I have in-depth experience with Unity and all the programs surrounding it. I know how to use Blender, Audacity, Visual Studio, and Adobe Illustrator. I have a solid understanding of game design concepts. I am comfortable with all the steps in creating, publishing, and promoting video games other than music production.

When I'm not making or playing games, I love to make renders on Blender, make YouTube videos, hang out with friends, watch movies and go hiking.
