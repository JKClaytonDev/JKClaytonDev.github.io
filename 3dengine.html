<h1> 3D Projection in JavaScript</h1>
<h3><i>I am not using WebGL's 3D capabilities for this project...</i></h3>
-instead I am using a custom 3D projection algorithm to render this. To summarize, the code in this is converting 3D coordinates to 2D ones for the 2D canvas.
It requires all the points to be read every frame and sorted based on distance. I modified the algorithm to run better on most computers due to all the data it's crunching,
but it means there is a loss in accuracy and the camera can't look up/down. I've also implemented a (sort of) version of shaders to differentiate water and grass.

<br>You can move the camera with the WASD keys, but your movement isn't related to the direction the camera is facing.
