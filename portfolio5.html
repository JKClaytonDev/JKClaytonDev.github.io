<h3>Game Design:</h3>
SuperStructure is a 2D platformer where the player is supposed to explore the environment and learn more about it through subtle queues in dialogue and from level or background design. SuperStructure’s game design was important because it required me to keep players' attention. The gameplay itself is never intense, but it is necessary to pace the game in a way that keeps the player both immersed, focused, and attentive so they will notice specific details that hint at the bigger picture of the story. At the same time, the gameplay can’t become a distraction or players will miss the details. It was difficult to find the perfect balance and to tweak the physics and controls to match it.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
SuperStructure’s level design was approached very differently compared to my other games. The game was meant to be an immersive experience, my design was to exemplify storytelling instead of gameplay. I spent time working on designs that looked familiar and then warping them by using them in places that felt unfamiliar. I was also able to use parts of the level to help make the player feel uncomfortable through use of space and nonverbal hints and warnings.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The only character in SuperStructure is the player, who is designed to be reminiscent of low-poly action platformers. I spent the most time working on his animations and slightly tweaking the model to make sure that the player both felt human and immersible while also feeling empty and foreign. I was able to strike this balance through the semi-rotoscoped animations which helped his movement feel realistic while his appearance did not.<br><br>
