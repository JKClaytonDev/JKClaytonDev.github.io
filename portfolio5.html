<h3>Game Design:</h3>
SuperStructure is a 2D platformer where the player progressively learns more about the mysterious game world through subtle queues in dialogue and world details. The game design was integral because it must hold the player's attention. I kept players listening and on their toes through pacing. Playtesters were able to retain more information when I properly arranged sections of platforming, dialogue, and world detail in a way that would keep players interested and immersed.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The level design had a different approach compared to my other games. The game is an immersive experience. The level design exemplifies storytelling instead of gameplay. So unlike other games, my level design was aimed at storytelling, with gameplay taking a backseat. I spent time working on creating warped props and rooms. I used subtle design and conditioning queues to make the player feel uncomfortable in specific spaces from sound or level design queues. <br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The only human character is the player. He was animated and modeled to assure that the player felt human and immersible while also feeling empty and foreign. I struck this balance through the use of rotoscoped animations. The game ends with an encounter with one of the warped creatures created by the world, a praying mantis made of flesh. The creature's movements look squishy, and the design feels sensible in the world it inhabits while also being something that players cannot predict.
