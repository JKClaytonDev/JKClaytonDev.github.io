<h1>LEVEL BREAKDOWN GREED</h1></div>
<h2>Game Introduction:</h2>
CASTILLO: The Nine Circles is a FPS Collectathon where each level is an open area with 150 moneybags and 10 Power Shards to collect, along with 1 new ability to buy. You must explore each world and collect shards, and then use your newfound ability to go back to the hub and spend enough shards to open the next world.
<h2>Design Philosophy:</h2>
I designed nine distinct levels with the main goal of making each level as memorable as possible, and to differentiate each level from all the others.  Each level has slight Metroidvania elements, unlocking a new ability changes the way you traverse each level and opens up previously inaccessible areas. As development progressed, I added more areas only reachable by gliding, or large cross-map shortcuts you can take by gliding.
<h2>Level Introduction:</h2>
GREED is the fourth level of “CASTILLO: The Nine Circles”, it is a pivotal point because players unlock the ability to glide, which changes the way you traverse for the rest of the game. I initially built this level with narrow paths over water, unlocking the ability allows you to glide between them which is useful for enemy encounters. Throughout the development process, "Greed" went through several iterations to achieve the desired level of depth and uniqueness. Here is a breakdown of the evolution:

<h2>Iteration 1: Level Blockout</h2>
<b>What Worked: Looping layout</b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>What Didn’t: Lack of variation</b></div>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Based on the illustrator sketch. Two routes to unlock the ability, circle back to the central area to remove backtracking. Rewards gliding over gaps.<br><br>

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
All shards are sitting out in the open to grab, no unique objectives yet. There are many narrow paths making on-foot combat difficult.<br><br>

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Set in an enclosed ravine with three disconnected areas with a cave in the middle. There's a grassy area to the right and a boardwalk behind the cave.<br>

</div>

<div class = "iterationtitle">
<h2>Iteration 2: Vantage Point</h2>
<i>What Worked: Right area setpieces</i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>What Didn’t: Back area setpieces</i>
</div>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Two new elevated areas, a center vantage point lets players soak in the level and familiarize themselves. Second lower elevated point seen from spawn.<br><br>

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
You must go through a difficult combat sequence to get to the vantage point, enemy placements have also been changed to differentiate combat sequences.<br><br>
<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Started leading into thematics, added a giant moving slot machine along with playing cards in the right area and a giant pachinko ball in the back area.<br><br>

</div>
<div class = "iterationtitle">
<h2>Iteration 3: Connecting Areas</h2>
<i>What Worked: New Objectives</i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>What Didn’t: Right area color scheme</i></div>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Opened up a large gap over acid that connects side and back areas. You can just barely fly over it to skip going back through the center area.<br><br><br>

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Began to diversify the level with unique objectives, like a challenge to glide through flaming rings immediately after you get the ability to test your skills.<br><br>

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Transformed the level to address uniformity concerns, players will get lost if environments look similar. I themed it around arcades and casinos.<br>

<h2>Iteration 4: Center Area</h2>
<i>What Worked: Lighting overhaul</i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>What Didn’t: Back area boring</i>
</div>

<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Added more shortcuts and extra paths to diversify level navigation for to reward gliding. Wall-run takes you from the boss arena to the spawn area.<br><br>

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Added a new area to the left of spawn, it connects to a different area in the cave and has its own objective.<br><br>

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Changed the central area into a bottomless mineshaft with sparkling gold and blue lighting to contrast it. The border walls swapped with fences to see city.<br><br>

</div>
<div class = "iterationtitle">
<h2>Iteration 5: Finishing Touches</h2>
<i>What Worked: New side/back</i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>What Didn’t: Didn’t match concept art</i>
</div>

<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Right area is given more verticality to take advantage of glide ability, back area has spinning platforms that are difficult to time landing on.<br><br>

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Added buildable zipline shortcuts to reward thorough players. A claw machine minigame with a shard reward diversifies the objectives.<br><br>

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Finalized level theming, removing unfitting elements. Changed the right area to fully incorporate the city theme and themed the boardwalks around a mushroomy forest to match the pink acid.<br>


<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The iterative process I went through during the creation of “Greed” showcases my dedication to making levels cohesive and how I make sure to consider gameplay when designing levels. I had to make sure that the level fulfilled its role in the game, but also exceeded players’ expectations by having impressive design and aesthetics.
<br><br>
This method of iterative design worked well for refining how the player interacted with the level, specifically in rewarding creative use of the glide ability. The downside was that the visual theme of the level was constantly changing, and although it all came together in the end it may have been beneficial to have created a stronger plan from the start.
