<h1>LEVEL BREAKDOWN GREED</h1>
<h2>Game Introduction:</h2>
CASTILLO: The Nine Circles is a FPS Collectathon where each level is an open area with 150 moneybags and 10 Power Shards to collect, along with 1 new ability to buy. You must explore each world and collect shards, and then use your newfound ability to go back to the hub and spend enough shards to open the next world.
<h2>Design Philosophy:</h2>
I designed nine distinct levels with the main goal of making each level as memorable as possible, and to differentiate each level from all the others.  Each level has slight Metroidvania elements, unlocking a new ability changes the way you traverse each level and opens up previously inaccessible areas. As development progressed, I added more areas only reachable by gliding, or large cross-map shortcuts you can take by gliding.
<h2>Level Introduction:</h2>
GREED is the fourth level of “CASTILLO: The Nine Circles”, it is a pivotal point because players unlock the ability to glide, which changes the way you traverse for the rest of the game. I initially built this level with narrow paths over water, unlocking the ability allows you to glide between them which is useful for enemy encounters. Throughout the development process, "Greed" went through several iterations to achieve the desired level of depth and uniqueness. Here is a breakdown of the evolution:

</div>
<h2>Iteration 1</h2>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Based on the initial on-paper sketch. There are two routes to unlock the glide ability, and players are always able to circle back to the central area to remove any required backtracking. Rewards using your glide ability to get across gaps.

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
All shards are sitting out in the open to grab, no unique objectives yet. There are many narrow paths making on-foot combat difficult.

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Set in an enclosed ravine with three disconnected areas with a cave in the middle connecting everything. There is a grassy area to the right and a boardwalk behind the cave, and a semi hidden enclosed area around the corner.

</div>
<h2>Iteration 2</h2>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Includes two new elevated areas, a center vantage point lets players soak in the level and familiarize themselves. You can also see a second lower elevated point from the spawn which you can use to cycle back in case you missed anything.

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
You must go through a difficult combat sequence to get to the vantage point, enemy placements have also been changed to differentiate combat sequences from how they work in other levels, including a new level specific mimic enemy.
<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Started leading into thematics, added a giant moving slot machine along with playing cards in the right area and a giant pachinko ball in the back area.

</div>
<h2>Iteration 3</h2>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Opened up a large gap over acid that connects side and back areas. You can just barely fly over it to skip going back through the center area.

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Began to diversify the level with unique objectives, like a challenge to glide through flaming rings immediately after you get the ability to test your skills, along with a giant interactable pachinko machine to contextualize the area in the back.

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Started to transform the level to address concerns about uniformity, players might get lost if environments look too similar. I began to theme the level around arcades and casinos. I wanted to cover multiple Greed-related topics. I then turned the sky black to fit giant spotlights behind the slot machine.

</div>
<h2>Iteration 4</h2>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
Added more shortcuts and extra paths to diversify level navigation for clever players and to make the glide ability more rewarding. There is also a new wall-run sequence to take you from the boss arena to the spawn area.

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Added a new area to the left of spawn, it connects to a different area in the cave and has its own objective.

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Changed the central area into a bottomless mineshaft with minecarts moving on tracks under you, along with stacks of sparkling gold on the floor and strong blue lighting to contrast it. The central cave boardwalk has been changed to hang from the ceiling. The border walls were replaced with fences to see a city.

</div>
<h2>Iteration 5</h2>
<h3>Layout/Traversal:</h3>
&emsp;
The right area is given more verticality to take advantage of glide ability, which is then tested in the back area with spinning platforms that are difficult to time landing on.

<h3>Combat Sequences/Objectives:</h3>
&emsp;
Buildable zipline shortcuts lead from the left of spawn to the central area and from the right of spawn to the second elevated area. A claw machine minigame with a shard reward diversifies the objectives to make the level more memorable.

<h3>Theme/Environment:</h3>
&emsp;
Finalized level theming, removing unfitting elements along with new billboards around the level. Changed the right area to fully incorporate the city theme and themed the boardwalks around a mushroomy forest to match the pink acid.


<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
The iterative process I went through during the creation of “Greed” showcases my dedication to making levels cohesive and how I make sure to consider gameplay when designing levels. I had to make sure that the level fulfilled its role in the game, but also exceeded players’ expectations by having impressive design and aesthetics.
<br><br>
This method of iterative design worked well for refining how the player interacted with the level, specifically in rewarding creative use of the glide ability. The downside was that the visual theme of the level was constantly changing, and although it all came together in the end it may have been beneficial to have created a stronger plan from the start.
