<h3>Game Design:</h3>
CASTILLO: The Nine Circles, as a collectathon, required significant changes to gameplay elements to build upon the first game for players who complete them in order. Drawing inspiration from the Banjo Kazooie franchise, I adapted the FPS collectathon gameplay for extended map-traversal and adopted a more arcade-like style. I emphasized this style through a combo-counter, which encourages players to progress through the level and minimizes downtime. The prototyping process was lengthy, undergoing numerous iterations before reaching the current gameplay style.
<h3>Level Design:</h3>
Rethinking my approach to creating open-ended levels with multiple challenges, I changed how I taught mechanics through level design and emphasized player freedom. Balancing guidance and player choice, I sequenced levels to allow players to complete challenges in their preferred order. I focused on variety in gameplay, objectives, and level verticality to create memorable experiences. Each level is inspired by the circles of hell from Dante's Inferno.
<h3>Character Design:</h3>
Creating characters that fit the general tone of the game without feeling out of place, while also distinguishing them from the first game, was a key focus. The characters needed to align with the established canon and tone of Shattered Mirrors, while also assisting Dracula on his path to redemption. I made considerable efforts to improve my storytelling skills from Shattered Mirrors, striving to deliver a satisfying narrative that complements the game's nonlinear structure.
