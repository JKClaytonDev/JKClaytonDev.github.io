<h3>Game Design:</h3>
HyperJustice is an autorunner and third person shooter where you need to clear out all the enemies in each level. The main challenge with HyperJustice was making sure players understood the core gameplay mechanics. Without understanding the somewhat obscure mechanics players wouldn’t be able to consistently succeed in the game and written tutorials weren’t as effective as required. My solution was to add subtle changes in the field of view and screen tint while also having an on-screen meter to help players want to repeatedly use the mechanics.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
I decided to restrict the level design in this game to have the game-feel stay both consistent and more amplified than my normally open-ended levels. I still include multiple splits in levels to keep some player choice but was able to use the strict level design to my advantage. One example is how the player is restricted to one preset weapon for each level, it allowed me to design the spacing and enemy counts around that gun to both teach and test the player. One layout that would be stressful with one gun on one level might be an easy part with a different gun on a different level.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The characters in HyperJustice were designed to look like how we remember the late 90’s, human 3D models. With flat scanned-in faces and stub-hands. I designed the characters like this to fit with the tongue-in-cheek story and gameplay that are meant to reminisce on the era it is parodying. The characters were all designed with the specific constraints of the era in mind, keeping poly and bone counts low. <br><br>
