<h3>Game Design:</h3>
HyperJustice is an auto-runner and third-person shooter where you clear out all the enemies in each level. The main design challenge was properly teaching the core gameplay mechanics. Without an understanding the somewhat obscure mechanics, players couldn’t consistently succeed in the game, and written tutorials weren’t as effective as required. My solution was to add subtle changes in the field of view and screen tint while also having an on-screen meter to reward players for using the proper mechanics.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
I restricted the gameplay freedom to amplify the intensity. Levels still include forks for player choice, but I use the strict gameplay design to my advantage when designing each level. One example is how the player has one preset weapon for each level, which allowed me to design the spacing and enemy counts specifically around that gun to teach and test the player. One layout that would be stressful with one gun might be an easy part with a different gun on a different level.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The characters were designed to look like how I remembered the 1990's, low-poly human models seen in various video games. They have flat photo faces and stub hands. I also designed the characters like this to fit with the tongue-in-cheek story and gameplay. The characters were all designed with the specific constraints of the era in mind, keeping poly and bone counts low. <br><br>
