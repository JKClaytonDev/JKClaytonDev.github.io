<h3>Game Design:</h3>
HyperJustice is an auto-runner and third-person shooter where you need to clear out all the enemies in each level. The main challenge with HyperJustice was making sure players understood the core gameplay mechanics. Without understanding the somewhat obscure mechanics, players wouldn’t consistently succeed in the game, and written tutorials weren’t as effective as required. My solution was to add subtle changes in the field of view and screen tint while also having an on-screen meter to help encourage players to repeatedly use the proper mechanics.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
I decided to restrict the level design in this game to have the game-feel stay both consistent and more amplified than my normally open-ended levels. I still include multiple splits in levels to keep some player choice but use the strict level design to my advantage. One example is how the player has one preset weapon for each level, which allowed me to design the spacing and enemy counts around that gun to teach and test the player. One layout that would be stressful with one gun on one level might be an easy part with a different gun on a different level.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The characters were designed to look like how I remembered the 1990's, low-poly human models seen in various video games. They have flat photo faces and stub hands. I also designed the characters like this to fit with the tongue-in-cheek story and gameplay. The characters were all designed with the specific constraints of the era in mind, keeping poly and bone counts low. <br><br>
