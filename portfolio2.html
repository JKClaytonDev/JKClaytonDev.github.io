<h3>Game Design:</h3>
Flying Frags World Tour mixes the level-design principles of mid 90's 2D platformers with the gameplay of old-school FPS games. The main character must save the world from a robot invasion by traveling across the world and eventually into space. The gameplay slowly branches two concepts, combat and platforming. New gameplay challenges branch off and merge with others to create satisfying progression. <br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The level design includes a large variety of environments and challenges. The game includes two different level types, one where you have to get to the end of the level and another where you have to eliminate all enemies in the level. The level types change the way the player approaches combat situations. Each world is meant to both build off the previous one while also trying to give the player a new experience, I can do this by changing the variety of level types per world, removing a certain enemy or gun, or designing my levels with a different ratio of platforming to combat.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The enemies are designed to be easily recognizable. The player will find themselves in a large variety of combat situations in a large variety of lighting and background settings. All the enemies need to stay consistently recognizable because each enemy type requires a different approach to defeat. At the same time, I made sure that every enemy was able to show both their power level and hint at their vulnerability with their general shape and animation. Larger enemies generally have more health, parts of enemies that have animated glow are weak points, and parts of enemies that are animated are dangerous.<br><br>
