<h3>Game Design:</h3>
Flying Frags World Tour mixes the level-design principles of mid 90's 2D platformers with the gameplay of old-school FPS games. You are tasked with saving the world from a robot invasion by travelling across the world and eventually into space. The game design for Flying Frags is meant to slowly branch two concepts, combat and platforming. There are new challenges that branch off of familiar ones in ways that repeatedly teach and test the player until they are fighting a large variety of enemies while also managing mid-combat platforming.<br><br>

<h3>Level Design:</h3>
The level design in Flying Frags was meant to include both a large variety of environments and challenges. The game includes two different level types, one where you have to get to the end of the level and another where you have to eliminate all enemies in the level. The level types change the way the player approaches combat situations. Each world is meant to both build off the previous one while also trying to give the player a new experience, I can do this by changing the variety of level types per world, removing a certain enemy or gun, or designing my levels with a different ratio of platforming to combat.<br><br>

<h3>Character Design:</h3>
The enemies were designed to both be easily recognizable. The player will find themselves in a large variety of combat situations in a large variety of lighting and background settings. This means that I need all the enemies to stay consistently recognizable because each enemy type requires a different approach to defeat. At the same time, I also tried my best to make sure that every enemy was able to show both their power level and hint at their vulnerability with their general shape. Larger enemies generally have more health, parts of enemies that are animated are also generally weak points.<br><br>
